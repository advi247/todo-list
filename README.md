This is a Todo list website, for which I coded the backend files. This was part of my web D course, and the front end starter files were available in the course resources
1) open pgadmin4 and create a database 'permalist'. you can use any other database, but make sure to change the name of the same in the index.js file
2) open the queries.sql file and execute the commands in it
3) open a new terminal, and cd into the project folder
4) run npm i to install all the packages, and then check the dependencies in package.json. body-parser, express, ejs and pg must all be a listed under it
5) now execute the command **nodemon index.js**
6) go into your browser and type **localhost:3000**
7) the website will be rendered there
